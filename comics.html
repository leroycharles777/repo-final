     <p>When you think of Robin, you’re probably thinking about Dick Grayson. Dick Grayson’s origin starts off like many of them do. His parents were murdered during their performance at Haly’s Circus as The Flying Graysons. After the tragic loss of his parents, Bruce Wayne adopts Grayson and trains him in combat and detective work, preparing him for the role of Robin.</p>
     <P>Eventually, he leaves and takes on the moniker of Nightwing. He got the name from a Kryptonian story he heard from Superman. Grayson’s time as Robin, the leader of the Teen Titans, and ascension to Nightwing has established him as one of the most admirable superheroes. It’s made him the blueprint for Robins who followed.</P>
     <p>Jason Todd’s time as Robin was cut very short—not by choice. While he was Robin very briefly, he’s remembered because of his fate. When Bruce Wayne adopted Jason Todd, he couldn’t have chosen someone more opposite to Dick Grayson. Batman happened upon a young Jason Todd stealing the tires off of the Batmobile.</p>
